# Theory-of-Operators-in-Pyhton

Hi Welcome!

in this section we are going to learn abojut operators, which is useful concept of pyhton.

So what is the operator?
In simple term operators are Symbols tahat represent a mathematical and logical task.

Task Symbol
Addition +
Subtraction -
Multiplication *
Division / 

What are the types of operators?
1. Arithmetic Operators 
• Addition (+)   -> 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
• Subtraction (–)  -> 6 - 4 - 2 = 0
• Multiplication (*)  -> 3 * 5 * 6 = 90
• Division (/)    -> 5 / 3 = 1.67
• Modulo (%)      -> 5/3 = 2
• Floor division (//)   -> 5/3 = 1
• Exponent (**)     -> 2**3 = 8

2. Comparison Operators 
• Less than <
• Less than or Equal to <=
• Equal to ==
• Greater than >
• Greater than or equal to >=
• Not equal to !=
e.g:
x = 3 y = 5
Less than -> x < y -> True!

x = 17 y = 5
Less than -> x < y -> False

3. Logical Operators
• and  -> True only if both comparisons are True.
• or  -> True if either of the comparisons are True.
• not -> True if comparison is False and vice-versa.
e.g:

x = 5  y = 8
x < 5 and y > 8 --> True and False --> False.

x < 5 or y > 8 --> True and False --> True.

not x < 5 --> Not True



Thank You
